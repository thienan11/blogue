# bloguetown

A simple interactive blog site using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

Posts can be viewed without registering/logging in, but to create new posts, you need an account. The application uses JWT for authentication.

It is currently being updated with additional features. Visit it at https://bloguetown.vercel.app/.

## Installation

To install all necessary dependencies, run `yarn` in both frontend and backend directories.

## Running

To start the backend server, go into the backend directory and run `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js` when developing.

To start the frontend client, go into the frontend directory and run `npm start`.

## TODO

- [ ] Add functionality to reset password (email verification when registering)

- [ ] Add functionality to delete post(s)

- [ ] For each post add ability to like and comment

- [ ] Add post tags, possibly searching functionality?

- [ ] Add way to view profile and settings?
